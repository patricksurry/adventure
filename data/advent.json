To move, try words \nlike forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up \nor down.  \nI know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the \ncave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words \nI know. Usually you will need to give both the object and action words \n(In either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb \nalone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, \"inventory\" \nimplies \"take inventory\", which causes me to give you a list of what \nyou're carrying.\nThe objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird. \nUsually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more \nwords.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object \nare attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should \ntry a completely different tack.\nTo speed the game up, you can sometimes move long distances with a \nsingle word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building \nfrom anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note \nthat cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north \ndoes not guarantee entering the next from the south. Good luck!",

There is quite\na bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus\nnondescript bushes of various sorts.
